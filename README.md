# Online Health Intervention System for Maternal Patients

## Introduction

The implementation of information technology in healthcare systems has transformed how healthcare is administered to patients. The advent of online health intervention systems promises to increase patient safety, reduce medical errors, increase efficiency, and expand the reach of health programs for pregnant women (Goh and Agarwal, 2008). Today, electronic communication enables the establishment of a new set of systems, services, and applications in maternal health care (Heuvel et al., 2018). 

Technology has several advantages as a conduit for health intervention programs, such as faster data processing and patient data collection. These collected data can be used to build artificially intelligent information systems to improve the current healthcare structures (Goh and Agarwal, 2008). Online healthcare intervention programs provide a low-cost way for healthcare organizations and individuals to implement and track lifestyle modifications that enhance well-being. 

Unlike offline systems, online health systems enable healthcare companies to reduce their long-term staff expenses for client monitoring. They also allow for immediate delivery of medical assistance to people who require it throughout the day. The internet is increasingly being used to find health information on prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal concerns (Bert et al., 2013). A poll conducted in the United States revealed that more than 75% of pregnant women utilize online health intervention systems during their pregnancy (Bert et al., 2013). 

Furthermore, young women in their reproductive years frequently use the internet, social media, and smartphone apps (Wallwiener et al., 2017). This engagement rate among women emphasizes the need for maternal healthcare intervention programs, as women at the core of society must be educated on healthy living and safe hygiene practices. 

The internet also serves as a platform for sharing experiences and receiving peer support, which is essential for engaging women psychologically (emotions, feelings, mood), especially during physiological changes and frequent mood swings. 

We intend to implement an online health intervention system for maternal patients, focusing on factors that influence and limit the adoption and subsequent use of such systems. Our system will monitor women during their pregnancy, prenatal, and postnatal periods by uploading the location of the health center, collecting basic information of registered women, sending regular text notifications for upcoming prenatal visits, and recommending the nearest hospitals for emergencies. 

Additional functionalities include displaying recommended exercise routines and suggesting a healthy daily diet for pregnant women.

## Background and Motivation

The World Health Organization (WHO, 2022) estimates that over 34% of maternal deaths worldwide occur in Nigeria. A Nigerian woman's lifetime risk of dying during pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum, or after an abortion is 1 in 22, compared to 1 in 4900 in developed nations. Reducing maternal mortality and enhancing maternal health among Nigerian women requires a multifaceted effort involving healthcare professionals, citizens, and the government (Aderinto, 2022). 

We propose to develop an online health intervention system for maternity patients through a web application, analyzing the social and economic value of existing maternal intervention programs in countries like Ghana, Togo, and Cameroon. Our framework aims to effectively manage pregnant women's health, enabling them to self-service instead of waiting for mobility assistance to reach hospitals, thereby reducing the risk of unexpected labor and pregnancy complications. 

Our project targets the challenges posed by poor healthcare infrastructure in Adamawa State, aiming to recommend treatment centers and track the different stages of pregnancy, ultimately reducing maternal mortality rates and identifying life-threatening diseases in maternal patients.

## Scope of the Project

This project focuses on developing and implementing an online health intervention solution for maternity patients in Adamawa State, planned for the Spring 2022 semester and conducted within the American University of Nigeria (AUN) campus.

## Significance of the Study

The primary benefit of our system is enabling timely care for maternal patients. Our framework addresses the challenges faced by these patients in Adamawa State and serves as a resource for scholars interested in improving local healthcare infrastructure.

## Problem Statement

Maternal healthcare is essential for developing healthy individuals in society. However, limited access to maternity care, especially in rural areas, poses significant challenges. In Adamawa State, the absence of online intervention mechanisms increases pregnancy complications and maternal mortality rates.

## Aim of the Project

The aim is to develop an online web application that encourages and motivates women to participate in healthcare interventions to minimize pregnancy-related risks. We seek to understand online maternal health intervention systems and their potential to reduce maternal mortality rates among women in Adamawa State, Nigeria. 

Our system will incorporate industry-standard approaches to enhance user engagement, including asynchronous JavaScript, an attractive user interface, cloud solutions, and object-oriented system analysis and design.

## Objectives of the Project

1. Develop a monitoring system to track pregnant women from registration to successful delivery.
2. Refer pregnant women to nearby hospitals if complications are detected.
3. Send reminders for regular antenatal visits.
4. Provide medical advice on demand.
5. Follow up after complicated deliveries.

## Limitations of the Project

Several limitations were encountered during the project's design and implementation:

- **Finance**: To expand coverage beyond rural communities in Adamawa State to urban towns and globally, adequate financing is required.
- **Internet Connectivity**: Access to reliable internet is crucial for participation in the intervention system. Limited connectivity in rural areas restricts access to essential services.
- **Financial Resources**: Insufficient funding limits the study's scope to Adamawa State, hindering broader research impacts.
- **Lack of Motivation and Low Enrollment**: Motivating initial enrollment and continued participation in health programs is a significant challenge (Goh and Agarwal, 2008).
